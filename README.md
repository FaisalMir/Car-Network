# Installation Instructions
If you would like to install the application on your computer, following are the instructions on how to do so:
**Fair warning however:** based on my experience from creating this project, I have faced numerous bugs when it came to using **npm** instead of **yarn** so I would highly suggest using the latter. As well as making sure that the expo-cli and the package manager for yarn/npm is up to date.
If expo-cli is not installed on your machine, use the following code on your terminal:
```$yarn global add expo-cli```
To clone the application into your own directory:
```$ git clone https://github.com/FaisalMir/car-network.git ```

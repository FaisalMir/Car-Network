# Showcase
An app developed in React Native as a final project for CS 455 in the University of Regina

# Description
Car Network is a real-time bidding application designed for photographers to sell prints of their pictures to consumers. Users bid on a picture that they like and once the time goes down to zero, the user with the highest bid gains the rights to purchase the print!

# Technologies Used
To maintain the simplicity and overall effectiveness of this application, the usage of technologies was kept to a minimum. Following are the techonologies used in the application: 
* React Native
* React Navigation
* React Native Gesture Handler
* React Native Reanimated
* React Native Safe Area Context
* React Native Screens

# Installation Instructions
If you would like to install the application on your computer, following are the instructions on how to do so:
**Fair warning however:** based on my experience from creating this project, I have faced numerous bugs when it came to using **npm** instead of **yarn** so I would highly suggest using the latter. As well as making sure that the expo-cli and the package manager for yarn/npm is up to date.
If expo-cli is not installed on your machine, use the following code on your terminal:
```
$ yarn global add expo-cli
```
Or you can use: 
```
$ npm install --global expo-cli
```
To clone the application into your own directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FaisalMir/car-network.git
```
To install the dependencies setup for the package.json:
```
$ yarn install
```
Or you can use:
```
$ npm install
```

# Developer Operating Instructions
After all the dependencies and libraries are installed from the installtion instructions, the following command has to be used to run the application:
```
$ yarn start
```
Or you can use:
```
$ npm start
```
You can run the application via the localhost option. But to run it via an Android Virtual Device, you can download and install Android Studio to do so: https://developer.android.com/studio
